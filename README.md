# Configuration Dotfiles Installation #

Installs a bunch of common dot files and directories that live in your home directory. Not sure if anyone else will use this, it's mainly for me to keep track and keep in sync various workstations I use.

## How to use ##
 - `git clone https://github.com/DylanRJohnston/dotfiles.git`
 - `./install.sh`
 - Manually merge conflicting directories like .ssh and .vim #TODO make this automatic
